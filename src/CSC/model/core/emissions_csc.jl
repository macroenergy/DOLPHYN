    emissions_csc(EP::Model, inputs::Dict, setup::Dict)

This function creates expression to add the CO2 emissions for carbon supply chain in each zone, which is subsequently added to the total emissions. 

These include emissions from fuel utilization in DAC minus CO2 captured by flue gas CCS and also pipeline losses.

In addition, there is a constraint that specify that amount of CO2 that undergoes compression in each zone has to be equal to the amount of CO2 captured by DAC

```math
\begin{equation*}
    x_{z,t}^{\textrm{C,DAC}} = x_{z,t}^{\textrm{C,COMP}} \quad \forall z \in \mathcal{Z}, t \in \mathcal{T}
\end{equation*}
```
